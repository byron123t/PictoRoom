PictoRoom
=========

A revival of the PictoChat DS program.

## Usage

Users may easily set up their own servers by executing the `srv.py` program.

Users may also use the `client.py` program to connect to a server of their
choosing. These servers will be instances of the `srv.py` mentioned above.

The primary communication method is through drawing black and white pictures.
Users may draw pictures on the drawing panel, then click "send" to broadcast it
to the entire network. These pictures are shown in a real time feed above the
drawing space.
